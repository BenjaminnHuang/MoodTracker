# Sprint 1 Review (Week 7)
## Team #16: GitHubbies

### Achieved
- Consensus on how data should be saved & deleted
  - From each page, we know exactly how data will be stored.
  - We know eactly how data will be deleted (edit page).
  - Between calendar and edit page, we need to pass in which date we are modifying. Requires a local variable stord in `localStorage`.
- Issue template
  - Fixed format of all issues.
- Added more tags for issue and pull request.
  - bugs, documentation, design, etc
- Pull request template
- Tried to set up CI/CD
  - lint on javascript
- Clarified our workflow.
  - Only 3 deep branches. There are 3 branches from main, hello, calendar, edit. From each of those, we only branch once more for features/bug fixes/etc.
  - When done with a subtask of a particular page, make a pull request, linked with the corresponding issue. 
  - Review then merge.
