# Sprint 1 Retrospective
## 11/14/22

### What went well
    - White board that shows the tasks and who is assigned to that task
    - Conversation on discrepancy between visual design and actual implementation 
### What didn’t go well
    - Absent people didn’t get assigned to work
    - Meeting minutes were too vague for absent people
    - Open issues/PRs after completing the work
### Action Items
    - Absent people need to communicate their needs/confusions
    - Meeting minutes need to be more descriptive - anyone can understand the notes without previous knowledge
    - Open issues/PR before completing the work
