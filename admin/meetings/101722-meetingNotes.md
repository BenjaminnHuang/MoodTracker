# Last Week
- Assignments were done close to deadline
  - Solution could be to delegate tasks to more team members to spread out the work
  - We should plan ahead more and finish assignments during the weekdays
  
- Exam Feedback
  - Some of us felt like the questions were really specific, while we were expecting more general topics to be asked

# Notes:
- The Brainstorming Meeting will be about:
  - What do we want to build?
  - Discuss user stories/personas that will influence our project
  - Theme and architecture of the application
  - Make these ideas into a pitch
  
- Project Guidelines:
  - CRUD
  - Local-First
  - Information Management
  - Only can use HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS
  - Github must be used to keep track of all documentation/planning

- We added a weekly Slack channel for each week's discussions 


# To Do:
- Everyone needs to start sending daily standup messages:
  - Although there may not be much to discuss for now, it will help us get into the habit
  - Each person just sends a message in the Slack standup channel based on the included template
  - Keep in mind that these will be included in the group repository

- We need to figure out an additional weekly meeting
  - So we can have one for working and working for check-in discussions
