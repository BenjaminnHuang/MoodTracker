Hello! I am a Math-Computer Science major in ERC. I would like to become a software engineer but not work at a big company. I have an interest in music, specifically late romantic music and composition. I am very excited to create something polished with a team which in my experience always went horribly wrong. Hopefully all the scope restrictions and support from TAs help us through.
