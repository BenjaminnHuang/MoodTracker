### calendar

1. 7 col * 7 row (first row: day of week label, max 6 weeks in month)

2. can only go back to the past

3. leave spaces before the first day of month

4. a function to check how many days in month


## Design Decisions

**The size of out design is only for desktop (Macbook Air’s size)**


### Navbar (same for every page): 

1. clicking “logo” will always go to homepage

2. date: dynamically showing the current date, non-clickable

3. my calendar: click will go to calendar page


### Homepage:

1. Reflect image: **make an image OR use css styling text?**

2. Let’s go button: click will go to the prompt screen


### Prompt Screen:

1. Prompt text: “how are you today?”, fixed

2. Rating boxes: colors and texts are fixed

3. Add comment: 

    **a. how many characters max?**

    **b. comment box change size or not?**

4. Finish button: click will **create** an entry for the day in the data storage, and lead to the finish page


### Finish Page

Finish text: “Have a great day!”, fixed


### Calendar Page

**1. Dropdowns for month and year, showing all months and years since the app is launched (from December 2022 onwards)**

2. If users choose month and year that they have not started using our spp yet, all days should be white

3. If the user does not have an entry for a day, that day’s color will be white

4. The user can edit today and all the previous days; all future days are not clickable and white

5. The current day’s box should have a stroke


### Calendar Page Pop-up (not a new page)

1. After user clicks an existing entry, a pop-up for that entry will be shown

2. Showing date, rating, and comment

3. Background color is the rating’s corresponding color

4. If no entry or deleted, the calendar date will be white and not clickable

5. If no comment for that day, the comment place will simply be blank

6. Upper left corner has a “X”, clicks on it will close the pop-up

7. Upper right corner had “edit”, clicks on it will go to the pop-up edit


### Calendar Page Pop-up Edit

1. Can change rating and comment

2. update button: click on it will update that day’s entry

3. Upper left corner has a “X”, clicks on it will close the pop-up

4. Upper right corner had “delete”, clicks on it will delete that day’s entry (note: this action is dangerous since 

5. delete is irreversible and users cannot go back to add this day’s entry again)


### Code stely should be consistent

```
if (statement) {
    ...
}
else {
    ...
}
```
